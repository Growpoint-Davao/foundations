        "1. **Stop trusting yourself and your good works and start trusting in Christ alone for Salvation**. *“And by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God, not a result of works, Tso that no one may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)*",
        "2. **Turn away from everything the Bible calls sin**. *“But God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this steel, the Lord knows those are who are his and let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.” (2 Timothy 2:19)*",
        "3. **Attend a small group for personal discipleship and weekly worship service**. *And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the day drawing near”. (Hebrews 10: 24-25)*",
        "4. **Read and obey your Bible every day**. *This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. (Joshua 1:8)*",
        "5. **Tell others about your new relationship with Christ**. *“And he did not permit him but said to him, go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you. And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled” (Mark 5:19-20)*"

      "In every physical structure, the foundation is important. A building that has no strong foundation inevitably collapses. Likewise, a Christian that has no strong spiritual foundation is also in danger of spiritual collapse. Jesus reminds us of its importance at the end of the Sermon on the Mount.",
      "*...Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man **who built his house on the rock**. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who **built his house on the sand**. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. (Matthew 7:24-27)*",
      "In this parable, Jesus gives two kinds of foundation. One is the rock foundation; the other is the sand foundation. One can build his life on the rock by knowing and obeying the Word. Or one can build his life on the sand by simply ignoring it.",

However, before we can appreciate the good news, we need to understand why we need to start over. Why do we need to become a new creation? Why do we need salvation?"

      "1. There is an immeasurable gap separating God and man. What is the cause of this eternal separation? (Read Isaiah 59:1-2)",
      "*Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, or his ear dull, that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have made a sep- aration between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear. (Isaiah 59:1-2)*",

Many who sense the vast sepa- ration suppose that if they meditate harder, learn more about their religion, or just step into a religious sanctuary, they will be closer to God. But our separation from God is not just physical or intellectual so neither meditation nor knowledge or religious ritual can bring us any closer to God.",

      "The separation between God and man is **moral separation**. God is holy, man is not. God is good, man is not. God's standard is his glory, meaning his perfections. The problem is that we cannot be morally perfect like God. That’s why all are **eternally separated** from God. In other words, we are **disqualified** on our own to go to heaven.",
      "3. Furthermore, we need to understand that **sin has consequences**. What is the eternal consequence of our sin ac- cording to Romans 6:23?",

      "## The Solution\nThe Good News is that God did not leave us on our own to deal with our sins. God’s justice demands that **sin must be punished**. That’s why Jesus came to sacrifice Himself and paid the penalty for our sin on the cross.",
      "**God is holy**, righteous, and just, that’s why he could not allow sin to go unpunished. But **God is loving** and compassionate and merciful, he did not want man to be eternally separated from him. How can God punish our sins without eternally condemning us from His presence?",
      "The divine solution to this problem was for Jesus, God’s only son, to become the sacrifice for our sin."

But as it is, he has **appeared once** for all at the end of the ages **to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself**. And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, **having been offered once to bear the sins of many**, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.

      "What exactly happened on the cross? Through his death on the cross, **Jesus took our place and our punishment**. He **exchanged** his righteousness for our sin. He took our curse and gave us His blessing. Because of his sinless life, Jesus was the only one qualified to pay the penalty for man’s sin and to bridge the gap between God and man.",
