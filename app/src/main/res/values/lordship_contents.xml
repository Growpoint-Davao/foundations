        * Tell us about one person who has greatly influenced you, and what difference they made in your life.\n
        * Recall a time when you had to make a big decision. What was your decision-making process, and did it involve others?\n\n

        ## STUDY\n\n

        > *“Let all the House of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” (Acts 2:36)*\n\n

        Lordship is one of the central messages of the Bible. Jesus is referred to as Lord 100 times in the book of Acts and 622 times in the whole New Testament,
        while being referred to as savior only twice in Acts and twenty-four times in the New Testament. The biblical emphasis is overwhelmingly on the concept of lordship. Lord means master, the one who calls the shots, the one who makes the decisions.

        ## Lordship and Salvation\n\n

        1. What does Romans 10:9 teach us about believing and Lordship?\n
        > *If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. (Romans 10:9)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_2_part_2">
        The starting point of the Christian life is the acknowledgment of the Lordship of Christ. Confessing Jesus as Lord implies a submission to his Lordship in every area of life. If Jesus is our savior, then we should make Him our Lord.\n\n

        The brilliant author C.S. Lewis pointed out, that Jesus is either Lord of all as He repeatedly claimed, or he is a lunatic or a liar. It would be foolish to trust Jesus to save you or to follow him if he is not Lord of all as he claimed. If I say, \“Jesus is Lord\”, that means he is my master in every area of my life. This declaration is more than intellectual assent or lip service. It means we submit ourselves fully to him.

        ## Lordship demands Obedience\n\n

        2. From Luke 6:46 and Matthew 7:21, what did Jesus teach us about Lordship?\n
        > *Why do you call me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I tell you? (Luke 6:46)*\n\n
        > *Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the Kingdom of heaven, but **the one who does the will** of my father who is in heaven. (Matthew 7:21)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_3_part_2">
        As disciples of Jesus, our lives must be characterized by growing obedience to his commands.\n\n

        3. According to Jesus what is the Great Commandment in the Bible we must obey?\n
        > *\“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?\” And he said to him, \“**You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind**. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: **You shall love your neighbor as yourself**. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.\” (Matthew 22:36-40)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_3_part_3">
        4. According to John 14:15, what does real love for God look like?\n
        > *If you love me, you will **keep my commandments**. (John 14:15)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_4_part_1">
        5. What is God’s view of the person who goes through life pursuing wealth?\n
        > *And he told them a parable, saying, \“The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, \“Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.\”’ But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.\” (Luke 12:16-21)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_4_part_2">
        There’s nothing wrong with wealth. What is wrong is when money and possession replace the role of God in our life. Jesus calls a person who trusts and pursues wealth more than the will of God a fool.\n\n

        6. Is it possible to serve God and the world or ourselves?\n
        > ***No one can serve two masters**, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. **You cannot serve God and money**. (Matthew 6:24)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_4_part_3">
        7. Where should we store our treasure?\n
        > *Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but *lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven*, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. (Matthew 6:19-21)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_5_part_1">
        8. What is the major difference between the things of the world and the things of God?\n
        > *Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world——the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life——**is not from the Father** but is from the world. And **the world is passing away along with its desires**, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (1 John 2:15-17)*

        ## Lordship begins in the heart\n\n

        9. According to 1 Peter 3:5, where does honoring Christ as Lord begins?\n
        > *But *in your hearts* honor Christ the Lord as holy (I Peter 3:5)*\n\n

        Submitting to Christ as Lord is not about following a set of religious rules and traditions. Rather, **lordship is a matter of the heart**. Lordship begins as an internal submission of the heart. If it is genuine, it will eventually manifest itself in obedience.\n\n

        10. Explain in your own words what Colossians 3:23-24 means:\n
        > *Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. (Colossians 3:23-24)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_6_part_2">
        ## Lordship is a Continuous Walk\n\n

        11. What is the evidence that Jesus is your Lord?\n
        > *Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk in him (Colossians 2:6)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_6_part_3">
        We begin our Christian walk by acknowledging that Jesus is Lord. We must continue to walk under his lordship for the rest of our lives. Lordship is not having a one-time experience with God, but developing a lifetime walk with God. The more we know Him, the more we submit to Him.\n\n

        12. What does Luke 9:23 says we must continually do as we walk under the Lordship of Christ day by day?\n
        > *And he said to all, \“If anyone would come after me, **let him deny himself and take up his cross daily** and follow me.\" (Luke 9:23)*
    </string>

    <string name="lordship_page_7_part_1">
        Following Jesus and making him Lord means denying myself daily. It means that when what I want conflicts with what God wants, I have denied what I want to do what God wants.\n\n

        What do you think this means practically in your life?

    <string name="lordship_page_7_part_2">
        13. What promise do we have from God if we are willing to put Him first?\n
        > *But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and **all these things will be added to you**. (Matthew 6:33)*\n\n
        > *And **my God will supply every need** of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:19)*

        ## Personal Application\n\n

        * Are there areas in your life that you have not yet submitted to the Lordship of Jesus Christ? Areas you are struggling to obey God.\n
        * Are your relationships under his lordship?\n
        * Are your finances under his lordship?\n
        * Is your time submitted to his lordship?\n\n

        ## MEMORY VERSE\n\n

        > *…if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. (Romans 10:9)*
